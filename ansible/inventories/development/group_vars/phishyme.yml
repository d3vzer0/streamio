# This is the default settings file for the phishyme playbook.
# None of the variables will have to be changed for testing. In it's current state the following will be deployed:

# API on https://<your_ip>:8443
# UI on https://<your_ip>:9443

# A default firewall won't be enabled, so be carefull what you expose!

# PS. The certs role will create self-signed certificates. You can replace these with your own certs later on
